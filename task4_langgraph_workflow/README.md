# Task 4: LangGraph Workflow Agent

## Scenario
"Create a workflow agent that processes requests through multiple steps"

## Why LangGraph for Workflow Management?

### Advantages:
- **State Management**: Persistent state across workflow steps
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic routing based on conditions
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry and error recovery
- **Visual Workflows**: Easy to understand and debug flows

### Key LangGraph Concepts:
- **StateGraph**: Stateful workflow with nodes and edges
- **Node**: Individual processing step in the workflow
- **Edge**: Connection between nodes (conditional or direct)
- **State**: Shared data that flows through the workflow

## Implementation Strategy
1. Define workflow state schema
2. Create processing nodes (validate, process, notify)
3. Add conditional routing logic
4. Handle errors and edge cases

## Time: 10-15 minutes

## Explain Points
- Explain stateful workflows vs stateless functions
- Show conditional routing and decision points
- Discuss error handling and recovery strategies
- Mention workflow visualization and debugging
