# Task 2: CrewAI Multi-Agent System

## Scenario
"Create a document processing crew with specialized agent roles"

## Why CrewAI for Multi-Agent Systems?

### Advantages:
- **Role-Based Agents**: Each agent has a specific role and expertise
- **Task Delegation**: Automatic task assignment based on agent capabilities
- **Collaboration**: Agents can work together and share information
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to define agents, tasks, and workflows

### Key CrewAI Concepts:
- **Agent**: Autonomous entity with a specific role and goal
- **Task**: Work item that needs to be completed
- **Crew**: Collection of agents working together
- **Process**: How tasks are executed (sequential, hierarchical)

## Implementation Strategy
1. Define specialized agents (Extractor, Analyzer, Summarizer)
2. Create tasks for each processing step
3. Set up crew with agents and tasks
4. Execute workflow and collect results

## Time: 10-15 minutes

## Explain Points
- Explain multi-agent coordination vs single agent
- Show how agents delegate and collaborate
- Discuss role specialization benefits
- Mention scaling and fault tolerance
