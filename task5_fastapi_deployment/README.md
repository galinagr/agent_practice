# Task 5: FastAPI Production Agent

## Scenario
"Deploy an agent as a production API with proper error handling"

## Why FastAPI for Production Deployment?

### Advantages:
- **High Performance**: Fast async framework with automatic docs
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic integration for request/response validation
- **Auto Documentation**: Interactive API docs out of the box
- **Production Ready**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and error handling

### Key FastAPI Concepts:
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe request/response schemas
- **Dependency Injection**: Reusable components and middleware
- **Background Tasks**: Async processing for long-running operations
- **Middleware**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging, auth, CORS

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create FastAPI app with agent endpoints
2. Add Pydantic models for type safety
3. Implement error handling and logging
4. Add health checks and monitoring

## Time: 10-15 minutes

## Explain Points
- Explain API design for agent systems
- Show production concerns (logging, monitoring, errors)
- Discuss async processing and background tasks
- Mention deployment and scaling strategies
